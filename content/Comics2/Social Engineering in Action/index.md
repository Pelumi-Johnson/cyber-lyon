## 🦊 Issue #2  

## What Is Social Engineering?

## Arrival
{{< figure src="enter.png"
caption="ShadowFox steps into the outdoor seating area of **NeoComics Café**." >}}


Backpack light.  
Jacket unzipped.  
Laptop clean.

Nothing about him announces urgency.


In his head:

> *“Relax. Blend in. Order something cheap.”*

The waitress stops by.

{{< figure src="waitress.png"

**Waitress:**  
“What can I get you?”

**ShadowFox:**  
“Just a black coffee. Medium.”

She nods and walks off.

He sits.  
Orders coffee.  
Then notices her.

## First Observation
<div class="comic-panel">
  <img src="sits.png" alt="She’s seated **outside**, laptop open.">
</div>

She’s seated **outside**, laptop open.

Dark skin.  
Natural hair gathered into a neat, full bun.  
Business-casual, light blazer over a simple top.  
Composed. Focused.

Not scrolling.  
Not browsing.

Working.

In his head:

> *“Company work.  
> Not personal. Not school.”*

{{< figure src="chy.png"

## Character Lock-In

Her name is **Amani Brooks**.

She comes here often.  
About 45 minutes on break.  
Same table. Same chair.

Routine feels safe.

---

## Approach
He doesn’t interrupt.  
He waits for a pause.

**ShadowFox:**  
“Hey, sorry to bug you. Is this seat taken?”

{{< figure src="come.png"
caption="" >}}

Amani looks up briefly.

**Amani:**  
“No, you’re good.”

{{< figure src="wow.png"
caption="" >}}

She goes back to typing.

{{< figure src="bend.png"
caption="ShadowFox sits slowly, relaxed posture, coffee in hand" >}}

No tension.  
No suspicion.

---

## Light Conversation (Extended)

“ShadowFox leans back slightly. Amani keeps hand on the keyboard.”

**ShadowFox:**  
“Busy day?”

{{< figure src="put.png"
caption="" >}}

**Amani:**  
“Always.”

A half-smile.

**ShadowFox:**  
“I come here when I need to pretend I’m being productive.”

{{< figure src="gag.png"
caption="She laughs" >}}


The tension dissolves.

Humor does what questions can’t.

---

## Conversation Grows

Time passes.

Coffee cools.

“Amani gestures lightly as she talks. ShadowFox listens more than he speaks.”

{{< figure src="say.png"
caption="" >}}

They talk about:
- work routines  
- commuting  
- office culture  
- deadlines  
- how meetings always run long  

Nothing sensitive.

Nothing alarming.

Just life.

---

## Gentle Discovery

He doesn’t ask where she works.

{{< figure src="you.png"
caption="" >}}

He lets her offer it.

**Amani:**  
“I’ve only got about forty minutes. Just finishing something for work.”

In his head:
> *"There it is."*

**ShadowFox:**  
“Remote life?”

{{< figure src="yeep.png"
caption="" >}}

**Amani:**  
“Hybrid. I’m usually in the office. I work at **Northbridge Solutions**.”

She says it casually.  
Like it doesn’t matter.

To her, it doesn’t.

To him, it confirms context.

In his head:

> *"The name registers. He’s seen it before. Public information. Industry chatter. Nothing intrusive. Seeing one of their employees here — in the open — feels like timing."*

---

## What She Shares (Without Realizing)

They keep talking.

{{< figure src="ss.png"
caption="" >}}

She mentions:
- her role  
- what her team focuses on  
- what she enjoys  
- what frustrates her  
- what systems feel slow  
- what days are busiest  

Not secrets.

Patterns.

> *“ShadowFox nods, relaxed, curious — letting her lead.”*

{{< figure src="hmm.png"
caption="" >}}


She feels heard.

That matters.

---

## Rapport

Names are exchanged.

No titles.  
No credentials.

{{< figure src="yeeh.png"
caption="" >}}

Just people.

“Amani closes her laptop.”

That motion matters.

---

## The Exit

Another woman approaches.

## Character Lock-In

Her name is Zara Okoye.

She comes here at the end of the break.
Always to collect, never to stay.

Same café.
Same timing.

Routine means it’s time to go.

{{< figure src="goo.png"
caption="" >}}

“Her friend arrives — relaxed, familiar.”

**Zara:**  
“You ready?”

{{< figure src="ready.png"
caption="" >}}

Amani checks the time.

**Amani:**  
“Yeah. Break’s over.”

They stand.

**ShadowFox:**  
“Good talking to you.”

**Amani:**  
“You too.”

{{< figure src="yaah.png"
caption="" >}}


He asks for her number.

{{< figure src="IG.png"
caption="" >}}

She pauses.

{{< figure src="hum.png"
caption="" >}}


**Amani:**  
“I don’t usually give my number out…  
but you can add me on Instagram.”

{{< figure src="fone.png"
caption="" >}}

Boundary set.  
Connection preserved.

They leave.

{{< figure src="wlk.png"
caption="" >}}

---

## What Changed (Quietly)

The chair across from him is empty.

The café hasn’t changed.

But **he has context now**.

Not access.  
Not credentials.

Understanding.

---

## Tone Shift

In his head:

> *“That was enough.”*

Not triumph.  
Not excitement.

{{< figure src="chi.png"
caption="" >}}

Confirmation.

---

## 🛡 Defender’s Lens

Nothing illegal happened.

Nothing suspicious occurred.

And yet, everything necessary for future risk was gathered.

This is the danger of social engineering:

It doesn’t feel like an attack.  
It feels like a conversation.

---

## Final Caption

> *“The most valuable information  
> is often given freely.”*

---

## 🦊 End of Issue #2

No alarms.  
No breach.

Just familiarity.

And familiarity is where risk begins.
